3-Every API end point should have a seperate file or a seperate module
-Every logical part of the application should be on a seperate file
-All routes of genres should be in genres.js

4-Middle ware functions: Note that middle ware are called in sequence

5- app.use()
This method is called to install a middle ware function in a 
request processing pipeline

6-app.use(express.json);
Express.json method. This method returns a middle ware function
The middle ware function reads the request, if there is a .json 
object in  the body of the request, it will pass the boby of the 
request into a json object.

                req.body

                                            Each middle ware function
                                             Terminates req/res cycle by 
                                             Returning a response object
                                             or

8-Creating a custom middle ware function,
app.use(function(req, res, next) {

})
next-In this case is a reference to the next middle ware function

9-Setting up app to debug mode:
export DEbug=app:startup


10-ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMING:
Call: A call back is a function that is called when the 
results of asynchronous function is ready
